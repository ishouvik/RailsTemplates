# iShouvik Rails Templates
I hate repeating the same steps while creating my Rails applications. Instead, I keep standardized templates to quickly spin up barebone Rails apps for new projects.

Please, feel to use the templates for your Rails apps and suggest chnages in the [issues](https://github.com/ishouvik/RailsTemplates/issues) section

## What's included
- iShouvik Rails Templates: [Mongoid](https://github.com/ishouvik/RailsTemplates/tree/master/mongoid)
- iShouvik Rails Templates: ActiveRecord (coming soon)
